  <h1>Interneting is easy</h1>
  <p>First you need to learn basic</p>
  <h2>Headings</h2>
  <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six level of headings.</p>
  <h2>Lists</h2>
  <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add a "ul" element</li>
    <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
    <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
    <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
    <li>Also note how numbers increment on their own</li>
    <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
  <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw a particular word or phrase.</p>
  <p>Other times, you need to be<strong> strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase</p>
  <p><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></p>
  <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
